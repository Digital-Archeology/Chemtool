Chemtool 1.6.14 – License Inventory

Overarching project license:

- The project ships a top-level COPYING containing the GNU General Public License, version 2 (June 1991). No "or later" language appears in the headers, so the canonical interpretation is GPL-2.0-only for Chemtool as a whole.
- Core application sources (main.c, draw.c, graph.c, chemproc.c, inout.c, templ.c, undo.h, etc.), documentation (README, main pages), templates, and localisation catalogs do not declare an alternative license; they therefore inherit the GPL-2.0-only terms.

GPL-2.0 components (compatible with the project license)
- main.c (header comment); the entire src root (all .c/.h files except those specifically noted below) – GPL-2.0.
- undo.c / undo.h (Matt Kimball’s libundo snapshot) – GPL-2.0, embedded directly in the project.
- Autotools helper scripts with GPL and a special exception that permits inclusion in GPL-incompatible packages: missing, config.guess, config.sub. The embedded exception allows distribution under the project’s GPL-2.0 terms when shipped with Chemtool.
- Files generated by Automake (Makefile.in, m4/Makefile.in, po/Makefile.in.in, etc.) carry FSF notices granting unlimited copying/modification provided the notices are preserved; they may be regarded as GPL-compatible and are routinely shipped under the project’s main license.

LGPL-2.0 (Library GPL) components bundled from GTK+/GNU gettext
These files remain under the GNU Library GPL (LGPL-2.0 or later). They are dynamically compatible with GPL-2.0, but the LGPL obligations (provide source and relinking rights for modifications) continue to apply to the files themselves.
- GTK+ widgets imported into the tree: gtkfilesel.c, gtkfilesel.h, gtkmenu.c, gtkmenu.h, and the associated helper gtkintl.h.
- GNU gettext runtime (intl/ directory: gettext.c, finddomain.c, plural.c, l10nflist.c, dcgettext.c, dcigettext.c, dcngettext.c, ngettext.c, log.c, printf.c, etc.). Each file header specifies the GNU Library General Public License, v2 or later.

Permissive or public-domain utilities
- install-sh – MIT/X11-style license inherited from the X Consortium (permission notice included at the top of the script).
- mkinstalldirs – declared public domain.
- autoclean.sh, autogen.sh, and other short project scripts do not include explicit notices; they are treated as part of the GPL-licensed code.

Combined-effect summary
- Because the fountainhead application code is GPL-2.0-only, the redistributable whole remains GPL-2.0-only. The included LGPL modules are license-compatible and may be shipped under the project’s GPL umbrella as long as their original notices and source remain available (Chemtool already meets this requirement by shipping full sources).
- Permissively licensed helper scripts impose no additional obligations beyond preserving their notices.

Distribution and compliance checklist
1. Ship the complete source tree (already required by GPL-2.0) including unmodified LGPL and permissively licensed files with their headers intact.
2. If gtkfilesel.*, gtkmenu.*, or any intl/ file is modified, provide the modified source under LGPL-2.0-or-later terms and retain attribution.
3. Preserve the MIT/X11 notice in install-sh and retain the public-domain attribution for mkinstalldirs.
4. When packaging binaries, include the GPL-2.0 license text (already present as COPYING) and reference the availability of the source for all components.
