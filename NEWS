  truncation of labels near the edges of a drawing)
- Corrected positioning and inter-character spacing of labels with sub- or superscripts
- Changed OpenOffice output to avoid LaTeX formatting (that fig2sxd does not support)

  in the current vesions of firefox and konqueror.

Fixes and enhancements in chemtool 1.6.7

  that occured when chemtool was built with GTK 2 instead of GTK 1.2
  (see ChangeLog for details)
- SVG export now adds a namespace header as required by current builds
  of the firefox browser
- SVG export now uses color values instead of color names for better
  SVGT compatibility

  blocks

- Added KDE directory install targets to the Makefile to allow installation
  to a temporary directory (Debian-like installations mainly).
- chemtool now compiles with GTK 2.x if it is available (this offers the 
  potential for non-western localisations). 

Fixes and enhancements in chemtool 1.6.3

- Chemtool should now build and run cleanly on 64 bit systems and OS X
- Sum formula/molecular weight program now handles the second and third
  row of transition elements.

Fixes and enhancements in chemtool 1.6.2

Fixes and enhancements in chemtool 1.6.1

  XFree86 raster fonts (1.6 absolutely required the 75dpi fonts)
- improvements to bond pruning underneath labels 
- better positioning of right-justified labels, better clipping limits 
  around labels

New features in chemtool 1.6

- universal import mode based on BABEL (both openbabel and babel supported)
- Formula weight calculator now handles all main group elements and the first
  row of transition elements, and accepts greek phi as phenyl substituent.
- Movable hexagonal or square grid backdrop
- Improved SVG export, optional preview bitmaps in EPS export, optional EMF
  export
- Cursor key support for pixel-precise drawing and moving 
- The cleanup function now corrects bonds that deviate from ideal
  horizontal or vertical orientation by a single pixel
- Color support (bonds and text can be red,green,blue,cyan,magenta or yellow). 
- Default bond length now configurable, additional grid positions at two and 
  three times this length added
- Added a brief help text to accompany the 'About' window in the 'Help' menu.
- Added alternate text font (Times Roman)
- An attachment site can be marked before saving a molecule or fragment,  
  which act as reference point for adding this fragment to other molecules 
  (previously, this had to be the first atom in a file). Attachment sites are 
  marked in the preview window by a small x.
- Background color can now be chosen for screen display and EPS export, and
  drawing whiteout boxes under labels is now an option ( off by default !). 
- Text at 8,10,12,14,17,20 and 24pt can now coexist in a drawing. 
- Increased allowed label length to 100.

- It is now possible to place an auto-incrementing counter at the cursor 
  position for numbering sites.
- Changed double bond drawing code to no longer switch sides depending
  on drawing (or rotation) angle. (As a result of this, some older drawings 
  will need fixing)
- Rescaling a molecule now also scales its labels. Downscaling beyond 
  zero size (causing strange inversions) is no longer possible. 
- Renamed the "Orbitals" template menu to "Symbols" and added "plus", 
  "minus" and a rearrangement arrow to it. 
- Added two new bond types, a triple bond with all three lines equal,
  and a quadruple bond.
